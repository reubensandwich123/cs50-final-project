                        I created FINalyze as a way to apply the programming skills I developed not only during CS50, but also through my self-directed exploration into data visualization and manipulation. In this project, I leveraged Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas, and used Flask to build the applicationâ€™s backend. The system follows an MVC-inspired structure, with Flask and Python serving as the controller, SQL as the data model, and HTML/CSS forming the user interface layer.
